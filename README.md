# [Project 1: Krakow Air Pollution Project](https://github.com/yeegorski/krakow_air_pollution)
* Scraped Krakow weather data from 2019 and 2020 and PM2.5 data
* Performed data preprocessing  (coped with missing data, transformed categorical features, scaled the data, removed the outliers, engineered new features, checked for multicollinearity)
* Performed exploratory data analysis
* Created and evaluated models with sklearn's LinearRegression and RandomForest  
* Created a python module on the model with the best performance


# [Project 2: Titanic Dataset (Kaggle)](https://github.com/yeegorski/titanic_logistic)
* Performed EDA, data cleaning, and feature engineering (Python)
* Predicted survivals of the passengers using logistic regression model (Python)


# [Project 3: Send-a-Tree Mobile Application: Project Overview](https://github.com/yeegorski/send-a-tree)
* Setted up a data server
* Downloaded and cleaned the data (bash)
* Automated daily dataload (bash)
* Performed segment, funnel, and cohort analyses (SQL and Python)
* Visualized the data in Google Data Studio
* Predicted the number of registrations in the app with linear regression (Python)
* Predicted missing data with Random Forests (classification) (Python)


# [Project 4: Travel Blog: Project Overview](https://github.com/yeegorski/dilans-travel-guide)
* Downloaded and cleaned the data (bash)
* Analyzed trends and important metrics (SQL)
* Performed segment and funnel analyses (SQL)

# [Project 5: LendingClub Dataset (Kaggle)](https://github.com/yeegorski/tf_lending_club)
* Performed EDA, data preprocessing (missing data, categorical data, train-test split, data normalizing) (Python)
* Engineered features from the existing variables (Python)
* Created and evaluated the model built using TensorFlow (Python)
